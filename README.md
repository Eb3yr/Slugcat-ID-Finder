# IDFinder

A library to generate Rain World creatures and search for traits. Currently implements generation of slugcats and scavengers, and searching for slugcats. See the releases tab for the most recent stable assembly, or build from the stable branch. Aims to eventually have feature parity with the in-game mod by [Alduris](https://github.com/alduris) and a supporting WebAssembly website to run it in any browser. 

A web API powered by this library can be found at [scugfinder.azurewebsites.net](https://scugfinder.azurewebsites.net/) with instructions on how to use it returned by the root endpoint.
