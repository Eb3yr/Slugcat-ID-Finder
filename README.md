# IDFinder

A library to generate Rain World creatures and search for traits. Currently implements generation of and searching for slugcats and scavengers. See the releases tab for the most recent stable assembly, or build from the stable branch. Aims to eventually have all the creatures that can be searched with the in-game mod by [Alduris](https://github.com/alduris) and a supporting WebAssembly website to run it in any browser.

A web API powered by this library can be found at [scugfinder.azurewebsites.net](https://scugfinder.azurewebsites.net/) with instructions on how to use it returned by the root endpoint.
